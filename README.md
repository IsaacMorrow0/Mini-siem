# 🔐 Mini SIEM – SSH Log Monitor with Slack Alerts
This is a small Python project that watches SSH logs for failed login attempts. If an IP address has too many failed logins (like a brute-force attack), it sends an alert to Slack.

Great for learning cybersecurity, log analysis, and basic alerting!

# ✅ What It Does
- Reads SSH log files (like /var/log/auth.log or test_logs/auth.log)

- Looks for failed login attempts

- Counts how many times each IP fails to log in

- Sends a Slack alert if any IP reaches the limit (default is 5 tries)

# Files
log_monitor.py – Main script that does the log reading and detection

alert_engine.py – Sends messages to Slack

test_logs/auth.log – A sample log file you can test with

requirements.txt – Python libraries you need

# 🧠 How It Works (Quick Summary)
Reads SSH log file line by line

Looks for lines with "Failed password"

Uses regex to extract the IP address and username

Tracks failed login attempts per IP

If an IP reaches 5 failed attempts, sends an alert to Slack

#🔧 To Add Next (Ideas)
Only alert if failures happen within 60 seconds

Add IP location lookup (GeoIP)

Watch live system logs with watchdog
